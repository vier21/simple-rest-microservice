Simple Rest Microservice
--------
I create this project to demonstrate how to implement simple microservice just using rest api for serve data or communicate to each service.
Just don't get startled if you find any weird code or pattern there because it still on development. Nothing fancy in this project there's no gRPC, Event-Driven, WebSocket, etc.
But I promise to implement other microservice communication method like gRPC in other repository soon.
